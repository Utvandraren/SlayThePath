# SlayThePath
Bachelor thesis project where me and my lab partner programmed a trained artificial neural network to choose the best path in the game slay the spire.
This is the part of the project containing the network itself which takes taking a csv. file as input to pick what path is the best.
The input file itself is created from another program being run in parallel with the network.
